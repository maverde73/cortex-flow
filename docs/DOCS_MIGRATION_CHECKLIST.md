## Phase 2: Create Unified Structure ðŸ”„

### Checkpoint 2.1: Create docs/ Structure
- [ ] Create `docs/README.md` (main index)
- [ ] Create `docs/getting-started/`
- [ ] Create `docs/architecture/`
- [ ] Create `docs/agents/`
- [ ] Create `docs/mcp/`
- [ ] Create `docs/workflows/` (already exists, verify)

## Progress Tracking

### Current Session Completed:
- [x] Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
- [ ] Phase 2: Create Unified Structure
- [ ] Phase 3: Migration by Category
- [ ] Phase 4: Main Documentation Files
- [ ] Phase 5: Verification & Cleanup
- [ ] Phase 6: Maintenance Setup

### Next Session Start Point:
**Checkpoint 2.1** - Create docs/ structure directories

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Naming Conventions Decided:
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `getting-started.md` not `Getting_Started.md`
- Be descriptive: `manual-prompts.md` not `prompts.md`
- Group by topic in folders

### Content Decisions:
- Keep README.md minimal, link to docs/
- CLAUDE.md stays, but also copied to docs/development/
- RELEASE_NOTES.md moves to docs/ but keeps visibility
- Scripts/tests keep minimal READMEs with "See docs/development/"

### What Gets Deleted vs Kept:
- DELETE: Duplicated content now in docs/
- KEEP: README.md (root), CLAUDE.md (project instructions)
- KEEP: .pytest_cache/README.md (pytest generated)

---

## Validation Criteria

Before marking complete:
1. âœ… All documentation in `docs/` with clear hierarchy
2. âœ… Master index at `docs/README.md` covers everything
3. âœ… No broken links
4. âœ… No lost information from old files
5. âœ… README.md points to docs/
6. âœ… Old files deleted (except keepers)
7. âœ… All examples tested and work
8. âœ… File organization follows CLAUDE.md rules
